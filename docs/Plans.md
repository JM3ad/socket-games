## Intentions

* Get the app functional:
  * Can visit index, which connects to websocket
  * Can play tic-tac-toe somehow against another player

Tic-tac-toe intentions:

* Can see who's go it is
* Can click & play against opponent

* Security - only right player can play
* Reconnection behaviour

Design:
